About transcript: 
My transcript java file basically reads the text file named input. Each line in the input file contains: student name, course code, course credit, student number, [P|E] (P stands for practical, which is associated to any 
types of assessment such as lab activity, exercises, homework, worksheets, etc. E stands for exam), as well as the grade and weight of each assessment each student took. 
The program then extracts the information from that file and then creates a new output file which will be a transcript.
The transcript shall list the overall GPA of each student, as well as the final grades of each course the corresponding student took.
It is possible that the total weight of the assessment in a row of the file does
not add up to 100. It is also possible that the total grade of a student is more than 100. These two cases are
wrong and therefore, an exception called InvalidTotalException was created by me to handle both flawed situations. 
The wronginput file is used to change the information of the students to your discretion to test out the exception.
