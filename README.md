This repository contains 3 of my finest coding projects that I would like to show as a demonstration of my coding skills. The codes are all written in Java. 
The first one named "Maze" is a maze solver. The second one named "Map" is about a car driving on a city map. The third one named "Transcript" is a transcript creator. 
Kindly refer to the text/pdf files about each of the programs found in the repository to learn more about how each program works.
The file about the maze is named "About Maze". The file about the map is named "About Map". The file about the transcript is named "About transcript".
Lastly, please enjoy!
