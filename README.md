Solving a Maze. The program will read in a text file which has 2 numbers on 
the first two lines. The first number is the number of columns and the 
second number is the number of rows in the maze. The numbers will be 
followed by grid of Xs and Os. The Xs represent walls while the Os 
represent pathways. The first row of the grid will have an S to mark the 
starting point, and the end will be marked with an E. There is only ONE 
correct path from S to E. The program finds such a pathway. Once the 
program finds the correct path, the correct path will replace the
correct Os with dashes (-).
